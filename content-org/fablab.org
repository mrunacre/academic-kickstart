*** This is a test 
- This post will be exported as
  =content/posts/breathney=.
- The /lastmod/ property in the front-matter is set automatically to
  the time of export.
**** A sub-heading under that heading
- It's draft state will be marked as =true= as the subtree has the
  todo state set to /TODO/.

With the point _anywhere_ in this /Writing Hugo blog in Org/ post
subtree, do =C-c C-e H H= to export just this post.

The exported Markdown has a little comment footer as set in the /Local
Variables/ section below.
