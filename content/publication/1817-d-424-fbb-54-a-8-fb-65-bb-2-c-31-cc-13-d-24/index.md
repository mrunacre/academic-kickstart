abstract: "Wind tunnel tests have been performed of individual and paired H-type Darrieus vertical-axis wind turbines. The turbines in the paired configuration are closely spaced, at 1.2 and 1.3 rotor diameters shaft to shaft, and are counter-rotating. Two directions of rotation were studied, one where the facing (inner) blades move along with the incoming flow, and one where the facing blades move against the wind. The wind tunnel tests confirm a net increase in the power coefficient of the paired configuration compared with twice the power coefficient of the individual turbine. We found average relative increases in the power coefficients between 13% and 16%, which is consistent with numerical studies available in the literature."
