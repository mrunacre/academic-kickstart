Wind tunnel tests have been performed of individual and paired H-type Darrieus
vertical-axis wind turbines. The turbines in the paired configuration are
closely spaced, at 1.2 and 1.3 rotor diameters shaft to shaft, and are
counter-rotating.

Two directions of rotation were studied, one where the facing
(inner) blades move along with the incoming flow, and one where the facing
blades move against the wind. The wind tunnel tests confirm a net increase in
the power coefficient of the paired configuration compared with twice the power
coefficient of the individual turbine. We found average relative increases in
the power coefficients between 13% and 16%, which is consistent with numerical
studies available in the literature.
