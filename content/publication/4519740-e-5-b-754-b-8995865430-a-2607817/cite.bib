 abstract = {Aerodynamic load variations caused by the tower of a horizontal axis wind turbine on the rotor blades, knownas tower shadow effect, were reproduced and studied in the wind tunnel using a setup that mimics theinteraction between the tower and the blade. Tufts were used to visualize and display the change in the flowpattern between the blade and the tower during the passage of the bladeExperiments were then performed to study the mitigation of the tower shadow effect by using microtabs.The effect of microtab deployment and retraction on the lift coefficient of a NACA0021 blade was studiedin a series of wind tunnel experiments at a Reynolds number of 130 000. The experiments show an increaseand a decrease in the lift coefficient for a lower and upper surface microtab respectively. The effect of themicrotab depends strongly on the angle of attack.Results from lift force measurements show that a lower surface microtab can mitigate load variations inthe case of an upwind blade. However, the variations in the lift force in the case of a downwind blade, wherethe blade passes through the wake of the tower, are of a different nature. The use of a microtab is not efficientin this case.},
