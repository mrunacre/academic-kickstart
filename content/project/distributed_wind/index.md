I have been working on distributed wind energy since 2007. Jochem Vermeir's PhD
thesis summarises a lot of the work that we did back then.
I was involved in IEA Wind Task 27 on Small wind turbines in strongly turbulent
environments and am currently involved in
[IEA Wind Task 41](https://community.ieawind.org/task41/home) on distributed wind.
I am also a member of the Small Wind Technical Committee of the European Academy
for Wind Energy. Quentin Deltenre is close to finishing his PhD thesis on
_Sustainable retrofitting of high-rise rooftops_ in which rooftop-mounted small
wind turbines play a role.
