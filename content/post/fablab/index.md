The Covid-19 pandemic is still progressing globally and a small but significant
fraction of patients need mechanical ventilation at some point. Although some
countries have sufficient ventilators, there are indications of a future global
shortage of such devices. Medtronic released documents for their ventilator,
showing a global urgent need. Rapidly prototyped, industrially manufactured
ventilators can help alleviate this shortage.

With crucial support from UZ Brussels , Flanders Make, Audi and other partners,
a team of 40 students, alumni, staff and external experts
at the Fablab Brussels have recently designed and prototyped
a ventilator
that has been produced industrially and is currently being tested extensively.

We intend to contribute to the
world-wide ventilator effort in the following way:

-   Perform the scientific experiments to investigate and iteratively increase the
    level of compliance with published requirements (e.g.
    <https://tinyurl.com/wfqtk4w>)
-   Demonstrate that a fully functional ventilator can be mass-produced (>100
    units daily for a mid-sized facility in e.g.&nbsp;automotive sector) with
    minimal pressure on the medical supply chain, by maximally sourcing components
    from non-medical sectors, at a well-documented unit cost that is affordable
    compared to conventional ventilators (without being low-cost per se)
-   Make available a toolbox for all aspects of ventilator system (mechanical,
    electrical, sensors, control, interface). The different aspects are designed
    in a modular manner so that e.g.&nbsp;the control unit can be used with both
    pump-based and pneumatic approaches
-   Make the design open-source. Share the design and documentation. Assist other
    groups worldwide in adapting design and setting up local production
