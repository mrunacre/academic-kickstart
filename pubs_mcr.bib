From an environmental perspective, the installation of a small building-mounted wind turbine on a rooftop can be meaningful.

@inproceedings{9fb40d1c2fa9486988b0580c197da529,  title     = "Improved resource assessment for small wind turbines in rural and urban areas",  abstract  = "1 Introduction In Flanders there are currently about 200 large windturbines (between 0.5 and 5 MW) installed. The number of small wind turbines (less than 100 kW) is roughly four times less, despite the much lower investment cost. It appears that the market of small wind turbines is deadlocked: small turbines still need technological improvement to close the performance gap with large wind turbines, but because there is no market, there is very little investment in research and development. Still, the public is supportive of wind turbines, and they think it important to invest in sustainable energy produc- tion (Van Hamme and Loix, 2011). In this paper we present the results of our feasibility study about small wind turbines in Flanders (Runacres et al., 2012). There are a number of small turbines on the market with adequate efficiency. Admittedly, many of the small wind turbines on the market are below par, but some are good enough to represent a viable alternative to other small-scale sources of renewable energy, such as photovoltaic panels. We have found that siting and resource assessment are an important impediment to the further development of small wind turbines. In particular, the classical methods for wind resource assessment are often not sufficient to obtain a reliable prediction of the annual energy production at a site suitable for small wind turbines (Willemsen and Wisse, 2002). The paper is organized as follows: we first present the general results of the feasibility study, focussing on the sensitivity of the approaches to predict annual yield. We then identify three key factors and propose alternatives that are scientifically more justified. 2 Feasibility study Are small wind turbines suitable to provide sustainable energy for SME's in Flanders? To answer this question, we performed wind speed measurements at various sites and conducted an exhaustive review of small wind turbines to compare the different characteristics. Combining these two aspects, we can make predictions of the annual energy production of different turbines at different sites. We performed wind measurements at 10.5 and 15 m, in built-up as well as rural areas. Our measurements were supplemented by measurements from the Royal Meteorological Institutes of Belgium (KMI) and the Netherlands (KNMI) and wind data available from project partners. For every site we constructed wind roses and energy diagrams and fitted different types of probability density functions to the data. Although these estimated distri- butions represent the data quite well (in terms of mean speed and overall shape), we found that energy yield predictions are very sensitive for the way in which the wind data are combined with the power curve. In our review of wind turbines, characteristics such as cut-in and cut- out speeds, rated power, the power curve, rotor diameter, and cost were collected for over 700 small wind turbines. To predict the annual yield at a certain site we only used turbines for which independently measured power curves were available. We also installed and tested two of our own small wind turbines. We found that rated power is a misleading indicator of the actual annual yield of a small wind turbine. To systematize the resource assessment we analysed a tool developed by Bruno Claessens and his collab- orators at Ap{\`e}re. This tool was used to predict the return on investment for different turbines at 18 locations in or close to Flanders, taking into account local wind speed, independently measured power curves, subsidies and fiscal policies. We extended the tool with our own measurements, added more wind turbines and improved the description of the atmospheric boundary layer. The tool is available for download from www.microwindturbine.be. The tool allows to use actual wind measurements as input data, or one can select a nearby measurement mast and a correction factor to take into account the surroundings (Wieringa, 1992). Often though the turbine will be installed at a height that differs from the height of the wind measurement. The wind speed then has to be extrapolated using the so-called log laws representing the atmospheric boundary layer. We compared different approaches using wind measurements at different heights and CFD simulations. Here again it turns out that the particular procedure used to correlate one wind speed to a different location can change the annual yield by a sig- nificant margin. To summarize, we have identified three key factors that determine the reliability of the resource assessment: * the detailed shape of the power curve at the wind speeds of interest, * the manner in which wind speed measurements are extrapolated from one height to another, * the method used to extract the distribution from the wind measurements. 3 Shape of the power curve We have performed resource assessment studies for ten different turbines using different sets of wind measurements and different density functions of the wind distribution. We found that rated power is a misleading indicator of the actual annual yield of a small wind turbine. The wind speed at limited heights (typically in the order of 15 m) and typical operating conditions of small wind turbines are invariably much lower than the rated speed. The cut-in speed and the steepness of the power curve at these low speeds will ultimately determine the annual energy production in a medium-to-low wind speeds area such as Flanders. This statement is illustrated by an example. The annual energy production of two different small wind turbines are compared for a specific site. Figure 1 shows the power curves of both turbines. A higher rated power and lower cut-in speed for turbine 1 can be determined from the figure. The wind data from a specific site is used to estimate the annual energy production. The results of the measurement campaign for a site in Flanders are shown. The figure shows the probabilty distribution of the measurements and the weibull distribution. As we now predict the annual energy production by the product of the probality distribution and the power curve, a higher energy production for turbine 2 is determined. The estimated annual energy production for turbine 1 is 2251 kWh/year and 2626 kWh/year for turbine 2. This implies also that what constitutes a 'most suited wind turbine' will be site dependent. In order to systematically compare different wind turbines for a given site one needs to compare the product of the wind distribution and the power curves. 4 Representation of the wind distribution In particular for the built environment and close to obstacles, the use of the Weibull distribution can give rise to substantial errors. Errors in ex- cess of 10{\%} were found when e.g. a Weibull distribution was used, as is customary in most resource analyses. This is mainly due to its inability to cope with the non-zero probability of very low wind speeds. This inability skews the distribution at higher wind speeds and translates into an error of the estimated annual yield. We compare different methods to alleviate this problem (Carta et al., 2009) and we compare the effect on the accu- racy of the predicted annual yield. We also investigate the applicability of such distribution for wind speed measurements at the rooftop of buildings. More specifically we investigate the method by Takle and Brown (1977) that combines the Weibull distribution with a probability for null wind speeds, and the maximum entropy probability density function (Ram ??rez and Carta, 2006) that is specifically suited to match frequency histograms of the cube of the wind speed, and thus a useful tool to evaluate wind resources at a given site. Takle and Brown (1977) define a hybrid probability density function P H : PH(U) = F0?(U) + (1 ? F0)PW (U) (1) where * F0 is the probability of observing zero wind speeds, * ?(U) is the Dirac delta function, * P W (U ) is the classical Weibull distribution, * and U the wind speed. Ram ??rez and Carta (2006) rather define their probability density function as M PM(U,?1,...,?M)=exp ?0+?iUi (2) i?1 The ?'s are the distribution parameters, and ?0 in particular describes the non-null probability of the very small wind speeds. We show that we increase the accuracy of the annual yield production by using the maximum entropy distribution to represent the wind data. 5 Extrapolation of wind speeds at different heights Different approaches exist to represent the wind speed as a function of height above ground level. Often a logarithmic profile is assumed, such as (Manwell et al., 2009): with U(z)= ? ln z U the wind speed [m/s], U? the shear speed [m/s], (3) ? the von Karman constant (0.41), and U ? z + z0 z the height [m]. There are however different variations of these laws, and the differences between the different logarithmic approximations are substantial. In the paper we systematically compare different log-law approximations and their effect on resource assessment using CFD simulations. We demonstrate the results using annual yield predictions for a given site in Ranst, Flanders. In figure 3 a CFD simulation of the wind flow over the terrain is shown. To perform a numerical simulation of the site, a wind profile must be applied at the inlet boundary. This profile is shown in figure 4. 6 Conclusions In this paper we have discussed three key factors that greatly influence the accuracy of the annual yield prediction for small turbines: * the shape of the power curve at low to moderate wind speeds, * the choice of the probability density function to represent the wind distribution, * and the extrapolation of wind speeds to different heights. Based on our feasibility study for small wind turbines in Flanders, we used wind measurements, power curve measurements and CFD simulations to predict the energy production for different turbines at a given site. We find that the rated power is not a good predictor of annual energy yield in the typical conditions under which a small wind turbine operates in Flanders. We find that the standard use of the Weibull probability density function can lead to substantial errors. We were able to improve the accuracy of the yield prediction by tuning the probability density function and the height variation of the wind. References Carta, J., Ram ??rez, P., and Vel ?azquez, S.

Recent research projects have advanced the state of the art both for GVT and flight tests, but the clear headway of a thorough integration has been neglected. In this paper we develop special excitation signals that can be used both on the ground and in flight, in combination with novel measurement techniques to better correlate the GVT measurements with a numerical model. More specifically, we will design multisine signals that allow to detect and quantify the level of non-linear distortions and optimise the measurement time. In this way more information is obtained from the aircraft with a better accuracy. The test time of a GVT is due in part to the labour?intensive instrumentation of the aircraft.

@inbook{24078336c7d24d76a3f9c24df5ff531f,  title     = "CFD modelling and measurements of the atmospheric boundary layer for micrositing of small wind turbines",  abstract  = "1 Introduction A major challenge in numerical siting studies over complex terrain is getting the atmospheric boundary layer right [1]. This boundary layer can be con- structed in two ways: setting a logarithmic wind profile at the inlet boundary, or applying a wall function to the ground to resolve the wind profile above. These two boundary conditions are complementary and can be used together. The difficulty is that these two boundary conditions satisfy different equa- tions. The inlet profile is set by 2 parameters, the friction velocity U? and the roughness length z0. The wall function is also determined by 2 parameters, the roughness height Ks and the roughness constant Cs. They are related by the roughness length z0: as a rule of thumb, Ks = 20z0. The functions described above will be used to demonstrate how the two boundary conditions can be tuned for simultaneous use. This type of rough- ness implementation is currently available in the CFD code OpenFoam 2.0.x. The solver that we use for this paper is SimpleFoam. It is a steady-state solver for incompressible turbulent flow, using a semi implicit method for pressure- linked equations. The solver allows to couple the Navier-Stokes equations with an iterative procedure. The selected Reynolds Averaged Stress (RAS) turbulence model is the k-? model. This paper first deals with the imple- mentation of the atmospheric boundary layer on a flat terrain. The results are then applied to a siting study on an existing terrain. The study is finally validated with on-site measurements. 2 Simulation of the boundary layer The two ways of setting the boundary layer are first studied separately and then applied together, on a flat terrain. Using the wall function only, a uni- form inlet velocity will be turned into a logarithmic wind profile over the surface. The value for the (constant) flow velocity at the inlet is carefully chosen. It is exactly the mean wind velocity of the expected wind profile, so the flow remains constant over the surface. Results show that the error between the simulated profile and the expected profile is less than 5 {\%}. Vari- ation of the roughness constant has a major influence on the error specially for lower heights. A constant value of 0.327 is chosen for Cs, which gives the best result. A second test consists of applying a logarithmic wind profile at the inlet and a slip boundary condition on the surface. The profile at the outlet of the case has exactly the expected profile. Combining both boundary conditions, it should be possible to set up a logarithmic wind profile that remains con- stant when moving over the surface (with wall function applied). If so, both boundary conditions are consistent and representative of the atmospheric boundary layer. A result for this simulation is shown in figure 1, where the wind profile at the outlet is compared with the expected profile (i.e. the profile at the inlet). 3 Siting study in complex terrain After studying both boundary conditions, we have applied them to a siting study on an existing terrain. In this case the complexity of the terrain is due to buildings. Terrain topography such as hills can be treated in the same way. We have measured the terrain with a total station and introduced it in the CFD code as a 3D surface. The first step in this study is to estimate the roughness length of the terrain. Tables with roughness lengths for each type of vegetation, height of and spatial area between buildings are present in the literature [2]. In the next step we have determined the parameters for implementing the boundary layer at the inlet of the case. These are determined by measuring the wind speed at 2 different heights (13 and 15 m) on the same location on the terrain by the use of 2 cup anemometers. The location of the mast should be chosen with care. If a certain wind direction is simulated, the mast should obviously be placed in front of the terrain and the flow should be nearly undisturbed. The measurement period is set to 1 to 2 days. We have chosen this period because an adequate estimate of the parameters has to be made. Therefore a sufficient amount of data should be gathered. Due to the variability of the wind speed and direction at these low heights, a few hours did not suffice to make a good estimate. The parameters can be calculated from these measurements by using the boundary layer equation. These parameters are then set to the inlet, in this way the correct boundary layer is implemented. In figure 2 the results of a simulation for the (dominant) South-West wind direction are shown. The variable that is plotted in the left part of the figure is the wind speed at a height of 15 m. A few interesting zones where the wind is accelerated (from 4 m/s at the inlet to 4,6 m/s) by the characteristics of the terrain can be seen. On the right hand-side of the figure the stream lines are plotted on a height of 15 m to show the turbulent regions above the terrain. 4 Validation The goal of these siting studies is to determine the best location to install a small-scale wind turbine. An important step in the study is the validation of the CFD simulations. The validation of these models is done by comparing the results of the simulations with field measurements. These consist of mea- suring the undisturbed wind velocity on 2 heights (to implement the correct boundary layers at the inlet as described above) and measuring the wind velocity on the terrain. We have chosen the location on the terrain using the results of the simulation. The mast is placed in a zone where the wind speed was accelerated and the turbulence was low. The measurements are then compared with the simulations. The error between the values of the wind speed is nearly 20{\%}. This error may seem large for siting studies in com- plex terrain [3], but when comparing field measurements with wind tunnel experiments in an urban environment this error seems reasonable [4]. Also it should be kept in mind that the validation is done at a height of 15 m where effects such as turbulence and fluctuation of the wind direction on a small time scale will influence the error between the numerical and experimental set-up. This error will certainly have an effect on the estimation of the en- ergy production of a potential wind turbine. However we can conclude from the measurement that the wind does really accelerates in the zone where the mast is installed as was indicated by the simulations.

This matrix-fraction description leads to a fast algorithm in the same way as the least- squares complex frequency-domain estimator (LSCF). The use of multiple inputs simultaneously in the estimation (so-called polyreference estimation) has the advan- tage that it allows to separate closely spaced modes. The main drawback of the LSCF estimator is that it is theoretically inconsistent, i.e. the estimates do not converge to the true values when the number of measurements increases to infinity. However, the noise information available from most measure- ments can be used to construct a maximum likelihood-like weighting for the LSCF estimators, giving consistent estimates. The results are fast, polyreference, and con- sistent weighted generalised total-least-squares (WGTLS) estimators. The iterative quadratic maximum likelihood (IQML) estimator is practically consistent for high signal-to-noise ratios, with the additional advantage that it yields clear stabilisation charts.

Because the optimization takes place on the response surface and not on the complex model itself, the number of function evaluations is reduced significantly. Higher order response models are used in combination with the adaptive approach. Additionally, the order of the interpolating functions can increase during successive iteration steps before the optimized design parameter values are achieved.

Most OMA estimators assume that the ambient forces are random noise sources with a flat amplitude spectrum. The transmissibility-based approach does not require this assumption: it works for almost any kind of ambient forces. The main advantage of the OMAX concept is the fact that it combines the advantages of Operational and Experimental Modal Analysis: ambient (unknown) forces as well as artificial (known) forces are processed simultaneously resulting in improved modal parameters. The main drawback of the existing OMAX estimators is related to the assumption that the ambient forces are white noise. In this paper, the transmissibility-based output-only approach will be combined with the input/output OMAX concept. This should result in a new methodology in the field of operational modal analysis allowing the estimation of (scaled) modal parameters in presence of arbitrary ambient (unknown) forces and artificial (known) forces. One important application is aeroelastic flutter. Flight flutter tests are necessary to assure that newly developed aircraft are free from flutter throughout the entire flight envelope. The airplane is excited by externally applied forces, but also due to turbulence. This turbulence excitation is not white at all, and can vary a lot between two flight phases.

We observed the radio emission of HD 167971 with the Very Large Array (VLA) and the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). By combining these data with VLA archive observations we constructed a radio lightcurve covering a 20-yr time-range. We searched for, but failed to find, the 3.3-day spectroscopic period of the binary in the radio data. This could be due to the absence of intrinsic synchrotron radiation in the colliding-wind region between the two components of the eclipsing binary,or due to the large amount of free-free absorption that blocks the synchrotron radiation. We are able to explain many of the observed characteristics of the radio data if the non-thermal emission is produced in a colliding-wind region between the supergiant and the combined winds of the binary. Furthermore, if the system is gravitationally bound, the orbital motion occurs over a period of ~20 years or longer, as suggested by the long-term variability in the radio data. We argue that the variability is due to the free-free absorption that changes with orbital phase or may also in part be due to changes in separation, should the orbit be eccentric.

These shocks are associated with an unstable, chaotic wind. The main improvement with respect to earlier models is the inclusion of the radial dependence of the shock velocity jump and compression ratio, based on one-dimensional time-dependent hydrodynamical simulations. The decrease of the velocity jump and the compression ratio as a function of radius produces a rapidly decreasing synchrotron emissivity. This effectively prohibits the models from reproducing the spectral shape of the observed non-thermal radio emission. We investigate a number of escape routes by which the hydrodynamical predictions might be reconciled with the radio observations. We find that the observed spectral shape can be reproduced by a slower decline of the compression ratio and the velocity jump, by the re-acceleration of electrons in many shocks or by adopting a lower mass-loss rate. However, none of these escape routes are physically plausible. In particular, re-acceleration by feeding an electron distribution through a number of shocks, is in contradiction with current hydrodynamical simulations. These hydrodynamical simulations have their limitations, most notably the use of one-dimensionality. At present, it is not feasible to perform two-dimensional simulations of the wind out to the distances required for synchrotron-emission models. Based on the current hydrodynamic models, we suspect that the observed non-thermal radio emission from O stars cannot be explained by wind-embedded shocks associated with the instability of the line-driving mechanism. The most likely alternative mechanism is synchrotron emission from colliding winds.

This improvement limits the synchrotron-emitting volume to a series of fairly narrow layers behind the shocks. We show that the width of these layers increases with increasing wavelength, which has important consequences for the shape of the spectrum. We also show that the strongest shocks produce the bulk of the emission, so that the emergent radio flux can be adequately described as coming from a small number of shocks, or even from a single shock. A single shock model is completely determined by four parameters: the position of the shock, the compression ratio and velocity jump of the shock, and the surface magnetic field. Applying a single shock model to the O5 If star Cyg OB2 No. 9 allows a good determination of the compression ratio and shock position and, to a lesser extent, the magnetic field and velocity jump.

This technique makes use of our previous finding that external forces play little r{\^o}le in the outer evolution of structure. Rather than evolving the entire wind, as is traditionally done, the technique focuses on a representative portion of the structure and follows it as it moves out with the flow. This requires the problem to be formulated in a moving reference frame. The lack of Galilean invariance of the spherical equations of hydrodynamics is circumvented by recasting them in a pseudo-planar form. By applying the technique to a number of problems we show that it is fast and accurate, and has considerable conceptual advantages. It is particularly useful to test the dependence of solutions on the Galilean frame in which they were obtained.

We concentrate mainly on the multiple system HD 167971 (O5-8V + O5-8V + (O8I)). The soft part of the EPIC spectrum of this system is thermal with typical temperatures of about 2 × 106 to 9 × 106 K. The nature (thermal vs. non-thermal) of the hard part of the spectrum is not unambiguously revealed by our data. If the emission is thermal, the high temperature of the plasma (~2.3 × 107 to 4.6 × 107 K) would be typical of what should be expected from a wind-wind interaction zone within a long period binary system. This emission could arise from an interaction between the combined winds of the O5-8V + O5-8V close binary system and that of the more distant O8I companion. Assuming instead that the hard part of the spectrum is non-thermal, the photon index would be rather steep (~3). Moreover, a marginal variability between our two XMM-Newton pointings could be attributed to an eclipse of the O5-8V + O5-8V system.

The non-thermal radio emission is believed to be due to synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons that have been Fermi accelerated in shocks. For HD 168112, it is not known whether these shocks are due to a wind-wind collision in a binary system or to the intrinsic instability of the stellar wind driving mechanism. Assuming HD 168112 to be a single star, our synchrotron model shows that the velocity jump of the shocks should be very high, or there should be a very large number of shocks in the wind. Neither of these is compatible with time-dependent hydrodynamical calculations of O star winds. If, on the other hand, we assume that HD 168112 is a binary, the high velocity jump is easily explained by ascribing it to the wind-wind collision. By further assuming the star to be an eccentric binary, we can explain the observed radio variability by the colliding-wind region moving in and out of the region where free-free absorption is important.

The radio emission on the other hand increases by a factor 5-7 between the two observations obtained roughly simultaneously with the XMM-Newton pointings.

Comparison with archive X-ray and radio data confirms the variability of this source in both wavelength ranges over a yet ill defined time scale.

The properties of bremsstrahlung, the dominant emission process at these wavelengths, make it sensitive to structure and allow us to study how the amount of structure changes in the wind by comparing the fluxes at different wavelengths. Possible forms of structure at these distances include Corotating Interaction Regions (CIRs), stochastic clumping, a disk or a polar enhancement. As the CIRs are azimuthally asymmetric, they should result in variability at submillimetre or radio wavelengths. To look for this variability, we acquired 3.6 and 6 cm observations with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), covering about two rotational periods of the star. We supplemented these with archive observations from the NRAO Very Large Array (VLA), which cover a much longer time scale. We did not find variability at more than the +/-20{\%} level. The long integration time does allow an accurate determination of the fluxes at 3.6 and 6 cm. Converting these fluxes into a mass loss rate, we find dot M = 3.5 x 10-6 Msun/yr. This value confirms the significant discrepancy with the mass loss rate derived from the Halpha profile, making zeta Pup an exception to the usually good agreement between the Halpha and radio mass loss rates. To study the run of structure as a function of distance, we supplemented the ATCA data by observing zeta Pup at 850 mu m with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) and at 20 cm with the VLA. A smooth wind model shows that the millimetre fluxes are too high compared to the radio fluxes. While recombination of helium in the outer wind cannot be discounted as an explanation, the wealth of evidence for structure strongly suggests this as the explanation for the discrepancy.

Our data include observations in the X-ray domain with XMM-Newton, in the radio domain with the VLA as well as optical spectroscopy. 9 Sgr is one of a few presumably single OB stars that display non-thermal radio emission. This phenomenon is attributed to synchrotron emission by relativistic electrons accelerated in strong hydrodynamic shocks in the stellar wind. Given the enormous supply of photospheric UV photons in the wind of 9 Sgr, inverse Compton scattering by these relativistic electrons is a priori expected to generate a non-thermal power law tail in the X-ray spectrum. Our EPIC and RGS spectra of 9 Sgr reveal a more complex situation than expected from this simple theoretical picture. While the bulk of the thermal X-ray emission from 9 Sgr arises most probably in a plasma at temperature ~ 3 x 106 K distributed throughout the wind, the nature of the hard emission in the X-ray spectrum is less clear. Assuming a non-thermal origin, our best fitting model yields a photon index of >=2.9 for the power law component which would imply a low compression ratio of =2 x 107 K. Our VLA data indicate that the radio emission of 9 Sgr was clearly non-thermal at the time of the XMM-Newton observation. Again, we derive a low compression ratio (1.7) for the shocks that accelerate the electrons responsible for the synchrotron radio emission.

Our EPIC images of this region reveal a cluster of point sources, most of which have optical counterparts inside the very young open cluster NGC 6530. The bulk of these X-ray sources are probably associated with low and intermediate mass pre-main sequence stars. One of the sources experienced a flare-like increase of its X-ray flux making it the second brightest source in M 8 after the O4 star 9 Sgr. The X-ray spectra of most of the brightest sources can be fitted with thermal plasma models with temperatures of kT ~ a few keV. Only a few of the X-ray selected PMS candidates are known to display Halpha emission and were previously classified as classical T Tauri stars. This suggests that most of the X-ray emitting PMS stars in NGC 6530 are weak-line T Tauri stars. In addition to 9 Sgr, our EPIC field of view contains also a few early-type stars. The X-ray emission from HD 164816 is found to be typical for an O9.5 III-IV star.

Variations in optical and ultraviolet line profiles reveal the presence of large-scale structure in the inner wind. The detection of X-rays and the existence of black troughs in saturated ultraviolet lines are indicative of small-scale structure. The geometric extent of both types of structure is poorly known. In principle, large-scale structure can be detected directly from very high spatial resolution observations that resolve the stellar wind. A simpler technique is to look for the presence of additional flux compared to that expected from a smooth wind. The run of this excess flux as a function of wavelength indicates how fast structure decays in the wind. If there is variability in the excess flux, it shows us that the structure must be large-scale. Such variability is suggested by two previous 6 cm radio observations of epsilon Ori: Abbott et al. (\cite{Abbott+al80}) found 1.6 +/- 0.5 mJy, while Scuderi et al. (\cite{Scuderi+al98}) measured only 0.60 +/- 0.06 mJy. This could indicate that the large-scale structure persists beyond ~ 50 R*. To further investigate this variability, we used the Very Large Array (VLA) to monitor epsilon Ori over a 5-day period in February 1999. We supplemented our data with observations from the VLA archive. In an attempt to resolve the stellar wind, we also obtained a series of high spatial resolution observations with the Multi-Element Radio Linked Interferometer Network (MERLIN) during January-March 1999. From this combined material we find no evidence for variability and we conclude that the Abbott et al. (\cite{Abbott+al80}) flux determination is in error. The data do show substantial excess flux at millimetre wavelengths, compared to a smooth wind. This excess is confirmed by a submillimetre observation which we obtained with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT). The behaviour of epsilon Ori is therefore similar to what had been found previously for alpha Cam, delta Ori A, kappa Ori and zeta Pup. While the present data do not allow very strong constraints, they show that considerable structure must persist up to at least ~ 10 R* in the wind of epsilon Ori. The combined radio fluxes are used to derive a mass-loss rate of log dot {M} (Msun/yr)= -5.73 +/- 0.04. This value is in good agreement with the Halpha mass-loss rate. The good agreement between Halpha and radio mass-loss rates for hot stars in general remains puzzling, as it implies that the same amount of structure is present in very different formation regions.",  keywords  = "stars: winds, outflows, Radio continuum: stars",  author    = "Ronny Blomme and Raman Prinja and Mark Runacres and Stuart Colley",  year      = "2002",  language  = "English",  volume    = "382",  pages     = "921--921",  journal   = "Astronomy & Astrophysics",  issn      = "0004-6361",  publisher = "EDP Sciences", }

The structure (i.e. inhomogeneities such as clumps and shocks) is generated by the instability of the line driving mechanism in the inner wind. It is self-excited in the sense that it persists even in the absence of explicit perturbations. The evolution of structure as it moves out with the flow is quantified by the radial dependence of statistical properties such as the clumping factor and the velocity dispersion. We find that structure evolves under the influence of two competing mechanisms. Dense clumps pressure-expand into the rarefied gas that separates them, but this expansion is counteracted by supersonic collisions among the clumps, which tend to compress them further. Because of such ongoing collisions, clumps can survive over an extended region out of pressure equilibrium with the rarefied surrounding gas. Moreover, the line-driving force has little r{\^o}le in maintaining the structure beyond about 20-30 R*, implying that the outer evolution can be simplified as a pure gasdynamical problem. In modelling the distant wind structure we find it is necessary to maintain a relatively fine constant grid spacing to resolve the often quite narrow dense clumps. We also find that variations in the heating and cooling, particularly the ``floor'' temperature to which shock-compressed gas is allowed to cool, can affect both the density and temperature variation. Finally, we find that increasing the value of the line-driving cut-off parameter kappamax can significantly enhance the level of flow structure. Overall, the results of our work suggest that structure initiated in the inner wind acceleration region can survive to substantial distances ( ~100 R*), and thus can have an important influence on observational diagnostics (e.g. infrared and radio emission) formed in the outer wind.",  keywords  = "hydrodynamics, instabilities, stars: winds, outflows",  author    = "Mark Runacres and Stanley Owocki",  year      = "2002",  language  = "English",  volume    = "381",  pages     = "1015",  journal   = "Astronomy & Astrophysics",  issn      = "0004-6361",  publisher = "EDP Sciences", }

This single shell can represent the joint effect of a number of shells and we discuss how multiple shells can be combined into a single shell. The shell strength parameter is introduced, which combines density contrast and width of the shell. From the 12, 25 and 60 micron IRAS observations of zeta Pup, we derive a shell strength and position. We find that the clumping is less extreme than predicted by the hydrodynamical models.

We can observe this wind indirectly through its characteristic effects on the stellar spectrum. In particular, this mass flow influences the line profiles. These so called P-Cygni profiles can be observed in the visual part of the spectrum of early-type stars and Wolf-Rayet stars, as well as - and even more clearly - in the ultraviolet part. In order to study the stellar wind structure, a computer programme was written which calculates theoretical P-Cygni profiles using the Comoving Frame Method. As input, this code can use the results obtained from other programmes, such as a non-LTE code. Through parameter adjustments a fit to an observed profile can be made.",  keywords  = "stars: winds, outflows",  author    = "Nadine Rons and Mark Runacres and Ronny Blomme",  note      = "U.
